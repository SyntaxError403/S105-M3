## Segregation Extensions:
segregation-restrictions is my modifed version of the sgrgeation model. My model restrcits the agents movements to only tree times. 

## Purpose:
I decided this modification because just like in the real world, your amount of movements might be limited. This can be due to only being able to afford a new house every 15 or so years, or in a more smaller scale scenario a student can only move to a different tabel so many times before the teacher gets frustrated. 

## Lesson Learned: 
I learned that by restricting the agents freedom and movements, they had less satisfactory results compared to when they complete freedom in movement. This is because the original model would allow the agents to move until they became happy.

## Rebellion Extension:
The rebellion-modified model adds a component of adding more cops if the rebel levels are getting too high. 

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this modification was to emulate how police might respond to rebellion and call for backup. This fits quite well with the real world, if a mod or protest starts spreading, police enforcement will enlarge as well to try to end the unrest. Along with more police, the area that is now viewable by police is increased a significant amount. 

## Lesson Learned: 
The lessin I learned from this model is that there can be many ways the counter agents (cops) can mitgate the negative effect the active rebelling agents have. I have also learned how to program a counter strategy.
