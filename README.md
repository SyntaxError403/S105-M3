## Segregation Extensions:
segregation-restrictions is my modifed version of the sgrgeation model. My model restrcits the agents movements to only tree times. 

## Purpose:
I decided this modification because just like in the real world, your amount of movements might be limited. This can be due to only being able to afford a new house every 15 or so years, or in a more smaller scale scenario a student can only move to a different tabel so many times before the teacher gets frustrated. 

## Lesson Learned: 
I learned that by restricting the agents freedom and movements, they had less satisfactory results compared to when they complete freedom in movement. This is because the original model would allow the agents to move until they became happy.
